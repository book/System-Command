    # invoke an external command, and return an object
    $cmd = System::Command->new( @cmd );

    # options can be passed as a hashref
    $cmd = System::Command->new( @cmd, \%option );

    # $cmd is basically a hash, with keys / accessors
    $cmd->stdin();     # filehandle to the process stdin (write)
    $cmd->stdout();    # filehandle to the process stdout (read)
    $cmd->stderr();    # filehandle to the process stdout (read)
    $cmd->pid();       # pid of the child process

    # find out if the child process died
    if ( $cmd->is_terminated() ) {
        # the handles are not closed yet
        # but $cmd->exit() et al. are available if it's dead
    }

    # done!
    $cmd->close();

    # exit information
    $cmd->exit();      # exit status
    $cmd->signal();    # signal
    $cmd->core();      # core dumped? (boolean)

    # cut to the chase
    my ( $pid, $in, $out, $err ) = System::Command->spawn(@cmd);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

System::Command is a class that launches external system commands
and return an object representing them, allowing to interact with them
through their C<STDIN>, C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR> handles.

=head1 METHODS

System::Command supports the following methods:

=head2 new

    my $cmd = System::Command->new( @cmd )

Runs an external command using the list in C<@cmd>.

If C<@cmd> contains a hash reference, it is taken as an I<option> hash.

If several option hashes are passed to C<new()>, they will be merged
together with individual values being overridden by those (with the same
key) from hashes that appear later in the list.

To allow subclasses to support their own set of options, unrecognized
options are silently ignored.

The recognized keys are:

=over 4

=item C<cwd>

The I<current working directory> in which the command will be run.

=item C<env>

A hashref containing key / values to add to the command environment.

If several option hashes define the C<env> key, the hashes they point
to will be merged into one (instead of the last one taking precedence).

If a value is C<undef>, the variable corresponding to the key will
be I<removed> from the environment.

=item C<input>

A string that is send to the command's standard input, which is then closed.

Using the empty string as C<input> will close the command's standard input
without writing to it.

Using C<undef> as C<input> will not do anything. This behaviour provides
a way to modify previous options populated by some other part of the program.

On some systems, some commands may close standard input on startup,
which will cause a SIGPIPE when trying to write to it. This will raise
an exception.

=item C<interactive>

If true, the command will actually be run using the L<perlfunc/system>
builtin. If C<STDIN> is not a terminal, the constructor will die.

Not reaper object will be created, and the C<stdin>, C<stdout> and
C<stderr> filehandles will point to dummy closed handles. The C<exit>,
C<signal> and C<core> attributes will be correctly set.

(Added in version 1.114.)

=item C<setpgrp>

By default, the spawned process is made the leader of its own process
group using C<setpgrp( 0, 0 )> (if possible). This enables sending a
signal to the command and all its child processes at once:

    # negative signal is sent to the process group
    kill -SIGKILL, $cmd->pid;

Setting the C<setpgrp> option to a false value disables this behaviour.

(Added in version 1.110.)

=item C<trace>

The C<trace> option defines the trace settings for System::Command.
The C<SYSTEM_COMMAND_TRACE> environment variable can be used to specify
a global trace setting at startup. The environment variable overrides
individual C<trace> options.

If C<trace> or C<SYSTEM_COMMAND_TRACE> contains an C<=> character then
what follows it is used as the name of the file to append the trace to.
When using the C<trace> option, it is recommended to use an absolute
path for the trace file, in case the main program C<chdir()> before
calling System::Command.

At trace level 1, only the command line is shown:

    System::Command cmd[12834]: /usr/bin/git commit -m "Test option hash in new()"

Note: Command-line parameters containing whitespace will be properly quoted.

At trace level 2, the options values are shown:

    System::Command opt[12834]: cwd => "/tmp/kHkPUBIVWd"
    System::Command opt[12834]: fatal => {128 => 1,129 => 1}
    System::Command opt[12834]: git => "/usr/bin/git"

Note: The C<fatal> and C<git> options in the example above are actually
used by L<Git::Repository> to determine the command to be run, and
ignored by System::Command. References are dumped using L<Data::Dumper>.

At trace level 3, the content of the C<env> option is also listed:

    System::Command env[12834]: GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL => "author\@example.com"
    System::Command env[12834]: GIT_AUTHOR_NAME => "Example author"

If the command cannot be spawned, the trace will show C<!> instead of
the pid:

    System::Command cmd[!]: does-not-exist

(Added in version 1.108.)

=item exit

=item core

=item signal

The above three options can be set to point to a reference to a scalar,
which will be automatically updated when the command is terminated. See
the L</Accessors> section for details about what the attributes of the
same name mean.

(Added in version 1.114.)

=back

The System::Command object returned by C<new()> has a number of
attributes defined (see below).


=head2 close

    $cmd->close;

Close all pipes to the child process, collects exit status, etc.
and defines a number of attributes (see below).

Returns the invocant, so one can do things like:

    my $exit = $cmd->close->exit;

=head2 is_terminated

    if ( $cmd->is_terminated ) {...}

Returns a true value if the underlying process was terminated.

If the process was indeed terminated, collects exit status, etc.
and defines the same attributes as C<close()>, but does B<not> close
all pipes to the child process.

=head2 success

    if ( $cmd->success ) {...}

Returns a true value if the underlying process was completed successfully.

This necessarily waits until C<is_terminated()> returns true. It will wait by doing
a 100ms select, then checking to see if the command has terminated. If your command
never terminates, this method will never return.

=head2 failure

    if ( $cmd->failure ) {...}

Returns a true value if the underlying process was completed UN-successfully.

This is implemented under the hood as:

    return !$self->success

Please read that function's description for important caveats.

=head2 spawn

    my ( $pid, $in, $out, $err ) = System::Command->spawn(@cmd);

This shortcut method calls C<new()> (and so accepts options in the same
manner) and directly returns the C<pid>, C<stdin>, C<stdout> and C<stderr>
attributes, in that order.

(Added in version 1.01.)

=head2 loop_on

    $cmd->loop_on(
        stdout => sub { ... },
        stderr => sub { ... },
    );

This method calls the corresponding code references with each line
produced on the standard output and errput of the command.

If the C<stdout> or C<stderr> argument is not given, the default is to
silently drop the data for C<stdout>, and to pass through (to STDERR)
the data for C<stderr>. To prevent any processing, pass a false value
to the parameter.

For example, the following line will silently run the command to
completion:

    $cmd->loop_on( stderr => '' );

The method blocks until the command is completed (or rather, until
its output and errput handles have been closed), or until one of the
callbacks returns a false value.

The return value is true if the command exited with status 0, and false
otherwise (i.e. the Unix traditional definition of success).

(Added in version 1.117.)

=head2 Accessors

The attributes of a System::Command object are also accessible
through a number of accessors.

The object returned by C<new()> will have the following attributes defined:

=over 4

=item cmdline

Return the command-line actually executed, as a list of strings.

=item options

The merged list of options used to run the command.

=item pid

The PID of the underlying command.

=item stdin

A filehandle opened in write mode to the child process' standard input.

=item stdout

A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard output.

=item stderr

A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard error output.

=back

Regarding the handles to the child process, note that in the following code:

    my $fh = System::Command->new( @cmd )->stdout;

C<$fh> is opened and points to the output handle of the child process,
while the anonymous System::Command object has been destroyed. Once
C<$fh> is destroyed, the subprocess will be reaped, thus avoiding zombies.
(L<System::Command::Reaper> undertakes this process.)

After the call to C<close()> or after C<is_terminated()> returns true,
the following attributes will be defined (note that the accessors
always run C<is_terminated()>, to improve their chance of getting
a value if the process just finished):

=over 4

=item exit

The exit status of the underlying command.

=item signal

The signal, if any, that killed the command.

=item core

A boolean value indicating if the command dumped core.

=back

Even when not having a reference to the System::Command object any more,
it's still possible to get the C<exit>, C<core> or C<signal> values,
using the options of the same name:

    my $fh = System::Command->new( @cmd, { exit => \my $exit } )->stdout;

Once the command is terminated, the C<$exit> variable will contain the
value that would have been returned by the C<exit()> method.

=head1 CAVEAT EMPTOR

Note that System::Command uses C<waitpid()> to catch the status
information of the child processes it starts. This means that if your
code (or any module you C<use>) does something like the following:

    local $SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE';    # reap child processes

System::Command will not be able to capture the C<exit>, C<signal>
and C<core> attributes. It will instead set all of them to the
impossible value C<-1>, and display the warning
C<Child process already reaped, check for a SIGCHLD handler>.

To silence this warning (and accept the impossible status information),
load System::Command with:

    use System::Command -quiet;

It is also possible to more finely control the warning by setting
the C<$System::Command::QUIET> variable (the warning is not emitted
if the variable is set to a true value).

If the subprocess started by System::Command has a short life
expectancy, and no other child process is expected to die during that
time, you could even disable the handler locally (use at your own risks):

    {
        local $SIG{CHLD};
        my $cmd = System::Command->new(@cmd);
        ...
    }

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Alexis Sukrieh (SUKRIA) who, when he saw the description of
L<Git::Repository::Command> during my talk at OSDC.fr 2010, asked
why it was not an independent module. This module was started by
taking out of L<Git::Repository::Command> 1.08 the parts that
weren't related to Git.

Thanks to Christian Walde (MITHALDU) for his help in making this
module work better under Win32.

The L<System::Command::Reaper> class was added after the addition
of Git::Repository::Command::Reaper in L<Git::Repository::Command> 1.11.
It was later removed from L<System::Command> version 1.03, and brought
back from the dead to deal with the zombie apocalypse in version 1.106.
The idea of a reaper class comes from Vincent Pit.

Thanks to Tim Bunce for using L<Git::Repository> and making many
suggestions based on his use and needs. Most of them turned into
improvement for System::Command instead, once we figured out that the
more general feature idea really belonged there.

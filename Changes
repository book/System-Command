        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - use a IPC::Run-based implementation on Win32
        - thanks to a lot of testing help from Christian Walde (MITHALDU)
          the test suite passes on Win32
        - while working on this, we established that kill 0, $pid is broken
          under Win32 (reported to the perl5-porters mailing-list via
          <op.wvi2ygw1ydyjqt@digitizedsqueak.lancs.ac.uk>)

1.07 Wed Apr 18 03:00:50 CEST 2012
        [TESTS]
        - t/20-zombie.t sometimes failed because of a race condition.
          I'm now testing my assumptions, make the test in question a
          little bit useless, and closing RT #74959

1.06 Sun Jan  8 00:36:40 CET 2012
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - add tests that show that I don't understand what I'm doing
          with STDIN/OUT/ERR, and remove the offending code (RT #73614)

1.05 Fri Jul  8 09:16:25 CEST 2011
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - make spawn() work properly with subclasses

        - added tests that were created for version 1.02 to the MANIFEST

1.03 Thu Mar 17 22:47:38 CET 2011
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - removed all the System::Command::Reaper logic which, while
          being really nice, didn't actually add any value, and made
          things more complex

1.02 Tue Mar 15 20:27:29 CET 2011
        [FEATURES]
        - new method is_terminated() allows to inquire about the child
          process state
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added a relatively sane behaviour when a SIGCHLD handler exists
        - warns when such a SIGCHLD handler may prevent prevent the
          capture of status information at the death of a child process
        - added a -quiet option to silence the warning
        - ported fixes from Git::Repository to work with modules that do
          bad things to STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR (thanks to Todd Rinaldo)

1.01 Tue Feb  1 00:13:33 CET 2011

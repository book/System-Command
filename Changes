      attributes: sdtin, stdout, stderr, exit, signal, core
      (after discussion with TIMB in RT #106330)

1.109 Wed Jul 2 2014
    [BUG FIX]
    - fix the test failures on Solaris, thanks to Wolfgang Pecho
      (RT #82857). The reaper code was actually buggy (since v1.03!)
      and only accidentally worked on platforms where WNOHANG == 1
      (which was most of them)

1.108 Wed Feb 26 2014
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - the 'trace' option makes it possible to see exactly which commands
      were spawned, with their options (including environment)
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - style fixes

1.107 Sun Oct 20 2013
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - zombies do not exist under Win32, so no need to warn about
      waitpid return value (many thanks to MITHALDU for his
      continued help in testing on this platform)
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - removed duplicated NAME section
    [FUN]
    - more zombie quotes in System::Command::Reaper comments

1.106 Sat Oct 12 2013
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - brought back System::Command::Reaper, which properly deals
      with zombies
    - execute the command in its own process group whenever possible
      (thanks to Vincent Pit)
    [TESTS]
    - test for the zombie processes is not TODO anymore
    - tests for the timely destruction of the reaper are back

1.105 Sat Oct 5 2013
    [TESTS]
    - add a TODO test for the zombie processes created in certain cases
    - various other test improvements

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - rewrote the _spawn code to work properly under Plack

      have been squished again, and tests fixed to prevent
      re-re-introduction

1.102 Fri Jul 26 2013
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - ported an older fix from Git::Repository, to make System::Command
      work with modules that do bad things to STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR
      (thanks to Todd Rinaldo for his 2010 patch to Git::Repository)
      [work done during the patch -p0 hackathon]

    - use a IPC::Run-based implementation on Win32
    - thanks to a lot of testing help from Christian Walde (MITHALDU)
      the test suite passes on Win32
    - while working on this, we established that kill 0, $pid is broken
      under Win32 (reported to the perl5-porters mailing-list via
      <op.wvi2ygw1ydyjqt@digitizedsqueak.lancs.ac.uk>)

    [TESTS]

      little bit useless, and closing RT #74959

1.06 Sun Jan  8 00:36:40 CET 2012
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - add tests that show that I don't understand what I'm doing

1.03 Thu Mar 17 22:47:38 CET 2011
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - removed all the System::Command::Reaper logic which, while

      things more complex
